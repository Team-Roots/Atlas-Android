Roots is an app students use to instant message counselors anonymously when they need help, and the non-anonymous counselors can provide help by continuing the conversation over the app. The app provides a way for people to seek help from people within their communities without identifying themselves. <br> <br>
Roots' potential customers are residential housing at USC, charter high schools in Los Angeles and the Bay Area, and small business companies seeking a private, continuous, and anonymous feedback stream, starting with <a href="http://www.milestoneinternet.com/">" Milestone Internet Marketing</a>.
